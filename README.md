# Supermarket Pricing Analysis and Recommendation System üõí

In collaboration with Marina G√≥mez, Mar√≠a √Ångeles Magro and Eduardo Gonz√°lez.

This project aims to learn about the Spanish supermarkets by the use of data analysis, graph theory, and machine learning to study supermarket pricing patterns, identify market segmentation, and provide personalized product recommendations by the creation of a content-based recommender system. We aim to empower consumers with actionable insights in order for them to make more informed decisions. 

## Study Performed: 

* Scrape data from 11 different Spanish supermarket websites to collect product offerings and their key characteristics.
* Use the OpenFood API to retrieve information on product categories, labels, and Nutri-score for the scraped products.
* Perform extensive data preprocessing to standardize and consolidate the datasets into a single comprehensive dataset.
* Apply clustering techniques to analyze the dataset.
* Develop a recommendation system that suggests products based on user search queries.
* Conduct graph analysis to explore product communities and uncover other valuable insights.
* Create an interactive Gradio dashboard that integrates all of the above steps, allowing users to search for products using various filters, receive personalized product recommendations, and explore details about different supermarkets.
